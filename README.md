# Tasty Orders - A fictional food delivery webapp

A fictional food delivery webapp built with Next.js and React. User can browse through the menu, add items to cart and place an order. Webapp uses basic form validation and has a simple checkout process with a confirmation page. The meals are fetched from a FIREBASE database. Webapp sends order data to a FIREBASE database. Added a few animations with Framer motion.
